# Safety On Stellar (SOS): Emergency Medical Records on Blockchain

**SOS (Safety On Stellar)** is a blockchain-based emergency medical information system that ensures global access to critical health data during emergencies. By leveraging Stellar's blockchain technology, SOS provides healthcare providers worldwide with instant access to life-saving medical information, overcoming language barriers and geographic limitations.

You can find the project presentation [here](https://youtu.be/9_bl88VAiO4)

## üöÄ **Project Overview**

SOS offers a simple yet powerful solution for storing and accessing vital emergency medical information via the Stellar blockchain. The system focuses on critical data needed in emergencies:

- **Blood Type**
- **Critical Allergies**
- **Current Medications**
- **Medical Conditions**
- **Emergency Contacts**

Unlike traditional medical record systems that require complex integrations and permissions, SOS is designed for simplicity and universal accessibility in emergency situations.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Implementation**

### **Core Functionality**
SOS leverages Stellar's **Account Data Entries** as the primary storage mechanism for medical information, offering several key advantages:
1. **Simplicity**: Minimal blockchain operations required.
2. **Direct Storage**: Data is written directly to the blockchain.
3. **Universal Access**: Authorized providers can access data via a web interface.
4. **Cost-Effective**: Minimal transaction costs with maximum security.

### **Technical Architecture**
1. **Storage Layer**:
   - Each user has a dedicated Stellar account to store their emergency medical data.
   - Data is stored using standardized keys for universal recognition (e.g., `blood_type`, `allergies`).

2. **Access Control**:
   - QR codes linked to the user's Stellar account enable emergency access.

3. **User Interface**:
   - A web application for users to create and retrieve profiles.

## üåü **User Experience**

### For Individuals
- Simple registration process requiring minimal personal information.
- Easy input of critical medical data through user-friendly forms.
- Generation of personalized QR codes for wallets, phone cases, or wearables.

### For Emergency Healthcare Providers
- Instant access to critical patient information by scanning QR codes.
- Clear presentation of time-sensitive medical data (e.g., allergies, conditions).
- One-click access to emergency contacts.
- No specialized equipment required‚Äîjust a web browser.
